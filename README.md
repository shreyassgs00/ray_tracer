Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to render 3D objects on a 2D plane to simulate how an eye at the given point would perceive
a 3D object placed in the environment with the light source being randomly positioned in the environment.
The viewport is currently the x-y plane with 256 pixels, each at a unit distance of each other.

The python currently gives the reflected ray passing through the intersection point on the given sphere.
To run the program, simply run main.py and input the required parameters.
